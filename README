Welcome stranger!
This is simple client server chat application
written in C programming language running on console.

You need to have GCC compiler, make, pthread library installed
to compile. On Ubuntu you can install these using this command:
>sudo apt-get install gcc make build-essential

To compile both client and server just run 
>make
on root directory. If you want to separately compile
server or client, change to that subdirectory and run make there.

To run server run:
>make runserver
That will run server on port defined in Makefile SERVERPORT.
You can also go go server directory and run server:
server>./server <portnumber>

To run client:
>make runclient
That will run client connecting localhost on SERVERPORT.
If you want to connect to other address, you can go
to client-directory and run:
client>./client <ip.address.here> <port>
